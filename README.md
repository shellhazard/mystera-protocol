# mystera-protocol
This repo contains documentation for server and client messages sent and expected by the official [Mystera Legacy](https://www.mysteralegacy.com/) client.

The contents of `protocol.md` have not received more than cursory updates since August 2019, so while I would say it's unlikely that things are drastically different, keep that in mind should you decide to use this information for anything.
